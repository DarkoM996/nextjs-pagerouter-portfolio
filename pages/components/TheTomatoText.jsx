        The Tomato is a concept web app project about a food brand. The
        challenge here was to create a clean user interface that is nice to look
        at and relatively easy to use for just about anyone. Of course, this UI
        was designed to be responsive and fit in across many different screen
        sizes.
      </p>
      <p className="text-xl leading-normal text-primary_customGray-900  ">
        I approached this project by utilizing the brand's primary color and
        just adding a tint of it in the grays as well as the whites for
        consistency. The font of choice for the typography was Work Sans, which
        had the needed several font weights which were needed for this project.
        The focus of this project was to practice and improve general UI skills
        for dashboards.
