        Days started as a side project back in 2015 when I entered and won a
        design contest. This event sparked the beginning of a new business
        venture and a lasting friendship with Matt Davenport, an iOS developer
        from Manchester, UK. Over the years, we've teamed up on various iOS
        projects, but Days has always remained our primary focus and passion.
        We're committed to constant improvement, iteration, and, above all,
        learning, to ensure our users' satisfaction.
