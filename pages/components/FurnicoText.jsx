        Furnico is an ecommerce full stack web app that I designed in Figma and
        for which I made mockups in Photoshop as well. I decided to turn this
        project into a full stack ecommerce web app that I'm building in Mongo
        DB, Express, React and Node.Js aka the famous MERN stack. The process is
        well underway but today, the case study will talk about the design and
        the decisions relating to this process.

      <p className="text-xl leading-normal text-primary_customGray-900  ">
        Furnico started as a new and fresh take on designing an ecommerce web
        app for a fictional brand. The goal was to create a well designed and
        visiually stunning website that is easy to use. To achieve this, I opted
        for a brown color palette with a clean and modern layout filled with
        images with rounded corners, buttons etc so the user can have a warm and
        cosy feeling while navigating through the web app.
      </p>
      <p className="text-xl leading-normal text-primary_customGray-900  ">
        For now, I only have the designs to show. I made the mockups in
        Photoshop to showcase this design. The process of bringing this app to
        the web is underway with the usage of the MERN stack. Until that is
        done, checkout the pictures of the design below.
