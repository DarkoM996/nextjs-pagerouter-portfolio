        The idea behind this project came after the regular return from the
        Covid Pandemic where the coffee bars experienced a strong hit in terms
        of making money and forcing them to be shut down so they could barely
        survive. I decided to put an idea to the test: How would such a business
        fare if they had online presence where people can order a cup of online
        and drink on the go, at the shop or even home? And thus I began to work
        on this case study, calling it: CoffeeBar.

      <p className="text-xl leading-normal text-primary_customGray-900  ">
        Initially I decided to hit Google as a starting point just so I could
        get some form of secondary research that'd would get me some starting
        information on the local shops. The data that I gathered showed a
        decrease of 90% profit and in some cases, even higher. On the other
        hand, the e-commerce association in Macedonia showed a major improvement
        of people whose shopping habbits online transformed dramatically. Going
        from people who were scepticals to the ones that embraced. How much was
        the question?

      <p className="text-xl leading-normal text-primary_customGray-900  ">
        Initial research was needed to better understand the users' needs
        related to coffee drinking and to better understand the coffee drinking
        culture within my city.I made a mini questionare of several questions
        and sent it out to several close people who were all between the target
        ages of 22-34 ages with the income and professions that would respond
        positively to this idea.
      </p>
      <p className="text-xl leading-normal text-primary_customGray-900  ">
        A series of in person interviews were then conducted on 6 participants
        to identify their pain points, frustrations, needs and desires within
        the existing coffee culture to determine how the CoffeeBar could improve
        this experience. Following, I went in the next phase which was to
        analyze the gathered data and to start out the design process based on
        that.
      </p>
      <p className="text-xl leading-normal text-primary_customGray-900  ">
        Finally after so long, I finally got to the design part. The focus was
        to design a clear web app with minimal and clean design focusing on
        simplicity combined with visual beauty. I showed some initial designs to
        the target audience which responded postively overall.
      </p>
      <p className="text-xl leading-normal text-primary_customGray-900  ">
        Ultimately the coffee drinking culture in Macedonia as well as the
        Balkans is unique. It's social importance is even greater than I
        realized as majority of the coffee drinkers enjoy a cup of coffee in a
        coffee bar for more reasons than just the coffee such as companionship,
        quality time with a loved one etc.
      </p>
      <p className="text-xl leading-normal text-primary_customGray-900  ">
        There were some signs of a potential investment, but that'd be at least
        a decade away if not more. One option would be to offer a way to book a
        table at a customer's specific wanted time etc. Overall duo to unique
        coffee drinking culture, expensive distruction and just not enough
        interest, the Starbucks like business method is not profitable at the
        moment. Here are the designs that I came up with.
