        After the rebranding to @hotel, the platform underwent a transformative
        shift into a pioneering booking platform, offering exclusive rates and
        deals to its members. As a product designer, my role was instrumental in
        enhancing user experiences through comprehensive research, user testing,
        and crafting intuitive user flows. I collaborated closely with
        developers to translate design concepts into functional products.

        In addition to my design responsibilities, I also took on cross-team
        initiatives, drove conversations, crafted prototypes to aid
        decision-making, and successfully secured buy-in from stakeholders. I
        led entire design initiatives from conception to production, involving
        developers early in the process to gather their feedback, technical
        constraints, and resource estimates.
